                <p class="firstboxdescription smallheading">
                    Education is a human right, a powerful driver of development, and one of the strongest instruments
                    for reducing poverty and improving health, gender equality, peace, and stability. It delivers large,
                    consistent returns in terms of income, and is the most important factor to ensure equity and
                    inclusion

                    For individuals, education promotes employment, earnings, health, and poverty reduction. Globally,
                    there is a 9% increase in hourly earnings for every extra year of schooling. For societies, it
                    drives long-term economic growth, spurs innovation, strengthens institutions, and fosters social
                    cohesion.

                    Developing countries have made tremendous progress in getting children into the classroom and more
                    children worldwide are now in school. But learning is not guaranteed, as the 2018 World Development
                    Report (WDR) stressed.

                <p class="secondboxdescription smallheading">
                    Education helps a person to get knowledge and improve confidence in life. It can help you improve
                    your career and your personal growth. An educated person can become a great citizen in society. It
                    helps you to take the right decisions in life.

                    The modern, developed and industrialised world is running on the wheels of education. To be able to
                    survive in the competitive world, we all need education as a torch that leads the way. Mentioned
                    below are the various features of education which outline the importance of education in human life:
                <p> <b> Safety Against Crime:</b> The chances of an educated person getting involved in crime or
                    criminal acts are very low. An educated person is well aware of his/ her surroundings and is less
                    susceptible to getting cheated or fooled. </p>

                    Education in the 20th century:
                </p>
                <p class="thirdboxdescription smallheading">
                    The two World Wars weakened the military and political might of the larger European powers. Their
                    replacement by “superpowers” whose influence did not depend directly on territorial acquisition and
                    whose ideologies were essentially equalitarian helped to liquidate colonialism. As new independent
                    countries emerged in Africa and Asia and the needs and powers of a “third world” caused a shift in
                    international thinking, education was seen to be both an instrument of national development and a
                    means of crossing national and cultural barriers. One consequence of this was a great increase in
                    the quantity of education provided. Attempts were made to eradicate illiteracy, and colleges and
                    schools were built everywhere.

                    The growing affluence of masses of the population in high-income areas in North America and Europe
                    brought about, particularly after World War II, a tremendous demand for secondary and higher
                    education. Most children stayed at school until 16, 17, or even 18 years of age, and a substantial
                    fraction spent at least two years at college.
